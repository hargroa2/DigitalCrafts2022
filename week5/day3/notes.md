postman tests and sends methods, especially HTTP methods.

- POST sends information, but can structure a POST method to look like a GET
- GET is a basic one and simply receives data
- CRUD - the 4 actions you can do to the backend
- APIs are a gateway to the backend
- When you paste a link into a browser it does a GET request, especially APIs. You aren't providing them anything and are simply requesting for data and they send it back.

- A POST request allows you to send data somewhere and receive data back.

- PUT usualy updates something, PATCH is similar
