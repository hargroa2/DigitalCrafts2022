# Flexbox

- A modern CSS tool that was created to handle a lot of the problems that plagued early frontend development, specifically with layout

- Flex defaults to a row layout unless you change it

- Justify content will align the items up and down
- Space-around has uneven widths

- Align item centers them left to right

`display: flex;`

- A flex container will only affect its direct children, not the grandchildren inside another div
