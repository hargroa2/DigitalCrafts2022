# Loops
# Loops are used to go through a specific amount of times
# And execute code every time it goes through it
#It iterates over lists, dictionaries, call something multiple times
# ctrl + c cancels a program when you get in an infinite loop
#It does something WHILE this is true

#while (condition to evaluate):
#condition can be checked many times

# data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
# num = 0
# while 2 < len(data): # Gives you the length of a list
#     print(data[num])
#     num += 1

#for loop
# fruits = ["apple", "pineapple", "banana", "apple", "pineapple", "banana"]
# #for singularItem in list
# for fruit in fruits: #will print out as many items you have
#     print(fruit)
#     if fruit == "banana":
#         pass

#We use lists inside of for loops primarily

# data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
#names = ["student1", "student2", "student3"]
# num = 0
# for fruit in fruits:
#     for name in names:
#         num +=1
#         print(name)

# print(num) 
#generally, you don't have to do nested for loops. There are usually better solutions, but are good for traversing strings.
